# OGC API Features: source editions

Status: selected source editions verified on 2026-10-01. The original source baseline is `c65beeb8519f425ff8365c76e54e93baf8e17b07`; current implementation and declaration policy are documented below. This page is not a certification claim.

## Normative source set

| Source ID | Document / edition | Planned responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| OGC-P1 | [17-069r4, Part 1 Core 1.0.1](https://docs.ogc.org/is/17-069r4/17-069r4.html) | resource graph, limit/bbox/datetime, errors and representations |
| OGC-P2 | [18-058r1, Part 2 CRS 1.0.1](https://docs.ogc.org/is/18-058r1/18-058r1.html) | public CRS references, crs/bbox-crs, Content-Crs |
| OGC-P3 | [19-079r2, Part 3 Filtering 1.0](https://docs.ogc.org/is/19-079r2/19-079r2.html) | Queryables and selected filtering classes |
| CQL2 | [21-065r2, CQL2 1.0.0](https://docs.ogc.org/is/21-065r2/21-065r2.html) | selected typed filter language classes |
| GEOJSON | [RFC 7946](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7946) | geometry representation and default coordinate semantics |

Document header versions were read from these authoritative sources. Future standard revisions require an explicit scope decision. Selecting an edition does not advertise conformance; each advertised class requires matching implementation and official verification.

## Reference implementations and tooling

Jivan is pinned at `c9fba2bb5188ba43c27539740195085e92f0ad7d`; its [routes](https://github.com/go-spatial/jivan/blob/c9fba2bb5188ba43c27539740195085e92f0ad7d/server/routes.go), handlers, provider adapter and WFS3 output provide migration evidence. Their legacy behavior never overrides normative requirements.

The [OGC source/components repository](https://github.com/opengeospatial/ogcapi-features), [Features ETS](https://cite.ogc.org/teamengine/about/ogcapi-features-1.0/1.0/site/), and [TEAM Engine](https://github.com/opengeospatial/teamengine) are tooling references. Tool versions/components must be pinned by the tasks which adopt them; mutable master URLs are not immutable conformance evidence.

## Existing Tegola transport

[server.NewRouter](../../server/server.go) owns existing MVT/capabilities routing, URI prefix, CORS and observability. The additive option-aware router installs FeatureAPI over the immutable FeatureService and optional FeatureQuerier contracts. [config.Config](../../config/config.go) and [provider.Tiler](../../provider/provider.go) remain integration points.

## Declaration and verification policy

[ADR-0012](decisions/ADR-0012-feature-conformance-and-panic-containment.md)
defines an immutable admitted implementation registry and the intersection of
published collection capabilities. Core, GeoJSON, HTML and OpenAPI 3.0 are base
classes; Part 2 CRS additionally requires every collection to qualify. Empty
catalogs declare no classes. Part 3/CQL2 global declarations are withheld until
an appropriate approved validator is available. Their application endpoints and
separately identified normative supplements do not manufacture an official
executable-suite result.

The [conformance guide](../testing/ogc-conformance.md) describes the pinned suite,
normal CLI fixtures, exact-revision inputs, raw report classification and limits.
Diagnostic wrappers are separate from final product verification, and skips are
not passes. Runtime declarations do not establish an OGC certification.
