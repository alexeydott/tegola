# Feature API release

Tegola replaces Jivan's feature-serving role through its existing server and
provider packages. Use the [compatibility matrix](../migration/jivan-compatibility-matrix.md)
for each legacy endpoint, parameter and deployment disposition. This statement
does not imply identical historical behavior or an OGC certification.

## Source release status

The annotated source tag `v0.21.0-fork.2` was pushed on 2026-10-02 and binds
`db4e8ee73a3ddfe3b3c8e054c59e833b697dce85`. OGC implementation and the
MOS provider/diagnostic integration are included in this revision. The MOS
source branch ancestry was recorded while retaining the reviewed integration
tree from `8bc78cd4`. This is a source tag; no GitHub Release assets or AWS
deployment are asserted. See [Windows builds](../windows-release.md).

## Included capabilities

Opt-in publication exposes landing, API definition, conformance, collections,
collection metadata, items and individual items. The implemented profile includes
JSON and HTML, HEAD, link-driven paging, bbox and datetime, Queryables with the
documented CQL2 text subset, and supported public CRS transformations. See the
[API reference](../api.md), [configuration](../configuration.md),
[filtering contract](../filtering.md) and [CRS contract](../crs.md).

GeoPackage, PostGIS, MySQL/MariaDB and HANA publication requires each provider's
documented source identity, metadata and query guarantees. Explicit publication
and admitted capabilities determine the exposed API; configuring a provider alone
does not publish every layer. Existing tile endpoints remain available.

The optional Lambda binary uses the same assembled HTTP router. Its transport
contract covers buffered REST v1, HTTP v2, Function URL v2 and ALB with multi-value
headers enabled. Origin selection, stage mapping and transport limits are defined
in [ADR-0014](../architecture/decisions/ADR-0014-lambda-router-adapter.md).
Local invocation parity does not establish a deployed AWS integration.

## Candidate verification

Build from the reviewed revision using the [development instructions](../development.md).
Retain the revision, compiler version, binary hash and configuration hash with
the operator's acceptance record. Run the deterministic migration fixture and
checks described in the [migration guide](../migration/jivan-to-tegola.md), then
repeat representative requests with your own publication configuration.

The [conformance workflow](../testing/ogc-conformance.md) distinguishes official
suite results, supplemental checks and tool limitations. The
[performance guide](../testing/feature-performance-observability.md) describes
measured dataset-specific budgets; page limits do not guarantee cheap candidate
scans. Review nullable attributes, geometry dimensions, filters, actual next links,
public origins, HEAD, error responses and retained tile clients before cutover.

The source tag identifies the included implementation. Acceptance results remain
bound to their exact revision, fixtures and environment. A tag does not establish
OGC certification, live-provider acceptance for another installation, or deployment.

## Cutover and rollback

1. Preserve the previous working binary, configuration and proxy routing, with
   their hashes. Back up data through the normal database process.
2. Start the candidate separately against read-only publication sources. Verify
   its process path, configuration, revision and direct responses.
3. Migrate clients according to the matrix, including datetime, CQL2 and paging
   differences. Switch proxy routing only after operator acceptance.
4. If acceptance fails, restore the previous routing, binary and configuration;
   verify direct legacy requests and tiles again. Keep the failed candidate's
   evidence for diagnosis. Publication requires no destructive source migration.

Jivan is an independently managed upstream project. This migration changes
Tegola documentation and operator deployments; it makes no claim that upstream
Jivan has been modified or archived.
