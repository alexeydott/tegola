# Geometry formats

All standard providers (`mysql`, `gpkg`, `postgis`, `hana`) decode geometries
into an internal in-memory representation before projecting them to Web
Mercator and encoding them as MVT features. This document describes the
supported input formats, their bounding-box behaviour, and how
`GeometryCollection` values are processed.

## Supported formats

`geometry_format` is a provider-level default and can be overridden per
layer.

| Format | Value | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Native | *(unset / empty)* | The provider's own binary geometry handling: WKB-backed blobs for `postgis`/`hana`/`mysql` (`ST_AsBinary`), GeoPackage binary blobs for `gpkg`. |
| WKB | `wkb` | Plain OGC WKB, e.g. selected via `ST_AsBinary(...)` in custom SQL. |
| WKT | `wkt` | OGC WKT text, e.g. selected via `ST_AsText(...)`. |
| MOS | `mos` | Opaque MapplGIS MOS binary blob with integer-quantized coordinates. |

`geometry_fieldname` selects the column that carries the geometry (default
`geom`); `id_fieldname` selects the feature id column (default `fid` except
`postgis`/`hana`, see [provider-contract.md](provider-contract.md)).

## MOS quantization

MOS coordinates are integers in a packed linear unit. `mos_precision` (decimal
digits, default `0`) and `mos_units` (`mm`, `cm`, `dm`, `m`, `km`; default `m`)
define the scale factor applied when converting to metres. Explicitly set
`mos_precision`/`mos_units` always win over values detected from a
`MapplGIS LayerInfo` metadata blob during startup inspection (see
[provider-contract.md](provider-contract.md#system-info-auto-configuration-mos)).

## CRS handling

The layer SRID resolution order and the Web Mercator (EPSG:3857) conversion
are documented in [crs.md](crs.md). In short: tile bounds (`!BBOX!`) are
always expressed in the layer's resolved CRS, decoded geometries are
reprojected from that CRS to Web Mercator, and MVT encoding consumes the
reprojected geometry — one consistent CRS contract end to end.

## BBOX filtering per format

| Format | SQL filter | In-memory filter |
|---|---|---|
| Native | Provider spatial predicate against the indexed geometry (e.g. `&&`, MBR, RTree) | Exact bounding-box check |
| `wkb` | None (raw bytes are not database geometries) | Exact bounding-box check |
| `wkt` | None | Exact bounding-box check |
| `mos` | Provider-specific: none for `gpkg`/`hana`, indexed bounds columns (`MINX/MAXX/MINY/MAXY`) for `mysql` | Exact bounding-box check |

Because raw formats cannot use the database spatial index (except the
MySQL bounds-column case), spatial selectivity comes from the in-memory
bounding-box check applied to every decoded feature.

## GeometryCollection behaviour

`GeometryCollection` values (including nested collections) are handled in
three cooperating stages:

1. **CRS conversion.** The reprojection helper applies the CRS transform to
   every point of every member geometry, recursively. Collections are not
   flattened at this stage.
2. **MVT encoding.** `GeometryCollection` features are recursively flattened
   into separate MVT features, one per leaf geometry, so MVT never emits
   nested collections. Leaf multiparts are kept whole.
3. **Auto-styling** (`?style` generated styles). A layer whose collection
   mixes polygon and line leaf geometries gets two sibling style layers:
   a line layer rendered before the fill layer, with `"filter": {"$type":
   "Polygon"/"LineString"}` so leaf geometry classes are styled correctly.
