## Unreleased

Fork-specific changes on top of upstream master (post-v0.21.0, 2024-12-19). Fork releases follow the version scheme `v0.21.0-fork.N`; the first fork release is `v0.21.0-fork.1`.

Features

* Unified CRS contract for all standard providers (`mysql`, `gpkg`, `postgis`, `hana`): `srid` and `crs_defn` (full PROJ.4 definition) at provider and layer level, explicit configuration wins over source auto-detection. Tile bounds (`!BBOX!`) are reprojected into the layer CRS so filter, data and MVT encoding always agree on one CRS.
* Built-in EPSG registry (`basic/epsg`) and synthetic internal SRIDs (>= 340000001) for custom PROJ.4 definitions and MOS system-info projections.
* Shared geometry formats for all standard providers: `wkb`, `wkt` and the packed `mos` payload, with `mos_precision` / `mos_units` configuration and system-info auto-configuration (`MapplGIS LayerInfo`).
* GPKG provider reworked: native GeoPackage binary, WKB/WKT/MOS geometry formats, `gpkg_contents.srs_id` detection, RTree `!BBOX!` filtering for table layers and in-memory filtering (with optional bounds columns) for raw tables without GeoPackage metadata.
* MySQL / MariaDB provider with `auto` / `mysql` / `mariadb` geometry formats.
* HANA MVT provider (`mvt_hana`) alongside `mvt_postgis`.
* Memory and multilevel tile caches.
* Tile endpoint modes `?tile=status|update|getupdated` and cache invalidation via `?dirty`.
* Providers can be excluded from the binary at build time with the `noMysqlProvider`, `noGpkgProvider`, `noPostgisProvider` and `noHanaProvider` build flags (e.g. `go build -tags 'noMysqlProvider'`); `tegola version` reports the active set.
* Async metatile regeneration. The `?tile=update` and `?tile=getupdated` cache-maintenance endpoints no longer regenerate the full 8x8 metatile (up to 64 tile renders and cache writes) on the request path. `?tile=update` now returns `202 Accepted` and schedules the regeneration on a bounded background worker pool (previously `204` after regenerating everything synchronously); `?tile=getupdated` returns the requested tile after a single render and schedules the same background regeneration. Regeneration is single-flight per metatile — concurrent requests join the regeneration already in flight instead of starting another one — and background failures are logged at WARN and retried on the next request instead of being cached. Graceful shutdown cancels and drains in-flight regenerations before the cache is torn down. No configuration changes.

Breaking changes

* MySQL provider: the `proj4` config key was removed in favour of `srid` / `crs_defn`.
* PostGIS provider: `tablename` and `sql` are strictly mutually exclusive (startup error).
* PostGIS provider: `pool_*` connection-pool keys were introduced/renamed; review your `[[providers]]` blocks.
* **Redis cache: URI-only configuration.** The `redis` cache connection is now configured exclusively by the `uri` key (e.g. `uri = "redis://:secret@127.0.0.1:6379/3"`; schemes `redis://`, `rediss://`, `unix://`; DB via path or `?db=`, tuning via query params such as `?pool_size=2&dial_timeout=3s`). The legacy `network`, `address`, `password`, `db` and `ssl` keys are no longer accepted: configs that set them — or that lack a valid `uri` — now fail at startup with an error showing the exact before→after migration. Pool size and dial timeout fall back to go-redis defaults (10×GOMAXPROCS / 5s) instead of the previous 2 / 3s.
* `provider/postgis`, `provider/hana`: an MVT query naming a layer that is not registered with the provider now fails with a clear request error (`ErrLayerNotFound`, before any SQL) instead of logging a warning and continuing with a zero-valued layer (upstream behaviour). Custom SQL whose SELECT list omits the bounds columns still registers with a WARN only — that bounds-contract gate is unchanged.
* `provider/gpkg`: raw-table GeoPackage layers whose geometry column has no `rtree_<table>_<column>` shadow table now register with a WARN and a fallback tile-query plan (plain-bbox on the table's bounds columns, or full-table-scan + in-memory exact filtering when there are none) instead of failing registration. The plan is chosen once at registration via a `sqlite_master` probe; tile requests keep exactly one SQL round trip. Add the index with `SELECT CreateRTreeIndex(<table>,<geom>)` to restore the RTree plan.

Maintenance

* Go module dependencies upgraded (`go.mod` / `vendor` refresh): `redis/go-redis` v9.22.0, `SAP/go-hdb` v1.18.11, `gdey/tbltest` bumped to its final upstream revision, and the unused `arolek/p` dependency dropped.
* MVT protobuf code generation migrated from gogo to `google.golang.org/protobuf` (`protoc-gen-go` v1.36.12); the wire format is unchanged and the fork no longer depends on `github.com/golang/protobuf`.
* Built-in viewer: `maplibre-gl` upgraded to v5, the deprecated `babel-eslint` replaced with `@babel/eslint-parser`, and npm install scripts denied by default (`ui/.npmrc` supply-chain hardening).
* Logging consolidation on `log/slog` — all tegola logging now flows through a single stdlib `log/slog` backend. The `internal/log` facade keeps its API but is reimplemented on a `slog` TextHandler (output format changed from JSON to greppable single-line text with `level=WARN`/`level=ERROR`), with a new `Logger() *slog.Logger` accessor and nil-writer-safe `NewLoggerTo`. Ad-hoc `log.Printf`/`fmt.Print` diagnostics across cache, basic, maths, container, draw, `cmd/tegola` and server were routed through the facade: verbose breadcrumbs/timings at DEBUG (hidden at default level), anomalies and pre-crash diagnostics at WARN. No new dependencies; message texts preserved verbatim.
* SQL token substitution (`!BBOX!` et al.) is now SQL-context-aware across all providers (`gpkg`, `mysql`, `postgis`, `hana`) via a shared internal scanner (`internal/sqltoken`): tokens inside string literals, quoted identifiers, comments, and PostgreSQL dollar-quoted strings are left verbatim instead of being substituted or uppercased. Token detection follows the same rule — a `!BBOX!` mention in a comment or literal no longer satisfies custom-SQL requirements nor triggers the raw-format token rejection. Rendering, parameter replacement, validation and probes now select backend-specific lexical rules: PostgreSQL arrays and hash operators remain executable, while PostgreSQL escape strings, SQLite backslashes and MySQL comment syntax are handled separately. Legacy helper APIs retain their previous behavior; provider README files document supported SQL modes.
* Consolidate provider test setup into a shared `provider/test/fixture` harness for SQL-row fixtures, database/schema lifecycle, configuration assembly, and explicit tile bounds. Migrate GPKG, HANA, MySQL, and PostGIS tests, remove duplicate setup implementations, and define a request-aware MVT mock callback while preserving canned responses. Add harness unit tests and usage documentation. Test infrastructure only; production behavior is unchanged.
* Restore the standalone geom fork's dependency checksums and protobuf-compatible Go minimum; enforce read-only nested-module checks in CI. Document and smoke-test checkout-based downstream consumption, guard the local-replacement inventory, and verify independently vendored consumers build offline. The later module migration below completes remote-only consumption with published fork dependencies.

Module migration

* The Go module is now `github.com/alexeydott/tegola`, with direct dependencies on published `github.com/alexeydott/geom v0.1.1` and `github.com/alexeydott/proj v0.3.1`. Local dependency replacements are removed. Go consumers must update imports, including public geom types; server configuration and HTTP endpoints retain their existing contracts. See `third_party/README.md` for migration and remote-consumer verification.

Bugs

* Reject synthetic SRID hash collisions without rebinding existing layers or cached transformations; explicit registrations cannot overwrite an ID owned by another `crs_defn`. Cover registration order and stored layer IDs with regression tests.
* In-process simplification is enabled by default below its configured maximum zoom again. `ZEpislon()` now converts the tolerance from MVT coordinate units into WebMercator meters before simplification. The default is 10 units in the 4096-unit MVT extent, not 10 screen pixels. Layer/global opt-outs remain available. Polygons with holes and multi-component MultiPolygons now simplify when bounded validation confirms simple rings, unchanged winding/containment and disjoint filled interiors. Unsafe or inconclusive candidates preserve the original geometry, including existing boundary contacts.
* All four SQL providers now share CRS-aware pixel-width, pixel-height and scale-denominator calculations. PostGIS, MySQL and GeoPackage use source-CRS units rather than assuming WebMercator; custom tile pixel dimensions are respected. Geographic CRSs now use the source ellipsoid's local parallel-arc factor `N(phi) * cos(phi) * pi / 180` at the transformed tile center instead of the WGS84-radius spherical approximation, including geographic `crs_defn` with `+towgs84`. The horizontal denominator retains the OGC 0.00028 m pixel; geographic pixel dimensions remain in degrees. Non-WebMercator SQL thresholds may need adjustment.
* Fix geographic datum transformations in the Go `proj` fork: `longlat` and its aliases now apply the existing three-/seven-parameter `datumToWGS84` / `datumFromWGS84` math for datums in the fork's table and ellipsoid definitions with `+towgs84`, including custom ellipsoid parameters and synthetic `crs_defn` SRIDs. WGS84 identity remains supported. The two-dimensional API assumes zero input height in each direction. Unsupported grids, prime meridians, units and axes remain explicit registration errors; see the CRS contract for details.
* Tile status reports queued background metatile regeneration as `updating: true`, as well as work that has already started.
* Correct the MySQL point test fixture to standard 21-byte WKB and assert the decoded coordinates.
* Fix PostGIS registration probes for native geometry `!BBOX!` operands, compact zoom comparisons and trailing SQL line comments; skip NULL geometry samples during type discovery. Deferred MySQL queries with scale tokens require a resolved or explicitly configured source CRS instead of using provisional units.

* Custom SQL structural validation no longer requires the bounds columns in the SELECT result: they are validated only when they are part of the SQL result (their actual names are persisted for the bounds predicate), and a layer whose SELECT list omits them is registered with a warning under the resolved names (`layer > provider > MINX/MAXX/MINY/MAXY`) — the `!BBOX!` predicate resolves the bounds columns in the query's own scope. A missing `!BBOX!`/`!BOX!` token or a missing configured geometry column remain startup errors. Applies to all providers (`mysql`, `postgis`, `hana`, `gpkg`).
* MySQL provider: the connection DSN is now built from `mysqlDriver.NewConfig()`, preserving the go-sql-driver authentication defaults. Previously a bare config struct literal disabled `allowNativePasswords`, so accounts using `mysql_native_password` failed to connect with "this user requires mysql native password authentication".
* MySQL provider: `BIGINT UNSIGNED` (`uint64`) and `FLOAT` (`float32`) column values arriving from the driver's binary protocol hit the tag type switch's error fallback, so the affected tags were silently dropped from the tile while an `unexpected type for mysql column data` error was logged per row. Both types are now encoded into the MVT (`uint64` via the native `uint_value`, `float32` widened through its shortest decimal form so the tag matches the text protocol's value).
* Fixed line simplification producing self-intersecting geometries (needles/flipped spikes) on non-`mvt_postgis` providers. The Douglas-Peucker simplifier now uses true segment distances and topology validation (with a conservative fallback to the unsimplified input), ring normalization no longer drops spike vertices, and simplification no longer pre-truncates coordinates to integers. Simplified MVT tile bytes will change for `gpkg`, `mysql`, `hana`, `postgis` without server-side simplification, and generic MVT encoding; `mvt_postgis` is unaffected.
* HANA: compute pixel-width/height SQL tokens in the resolved layer CRS and scale denominators with CRS-aware unit conversion and the OGC 0.28 mm pixel. Support projected meters, feet/custom linear units, and geographic degrees converted using the source ellipsoid and center latitude; reject unsupported CRS/unit data explicitly. Preserve default WebMercator SQL values and context-safe substitution. Non-WebMercator SQL scale thresholds may need adjustment.

## 0.8.0 (2018-11-01)
**Features**
- provider/gpkg: use aliases and quotes in query for all column names (#486 @olt)

- cmd: added support for `TEGOLA_PPROF_MUTEX_RATE` and `TEGOLA_PPROF_BLOCK_RATE` env vars when `pprof` is enabled. (@gdey)

**Bug Fixes**
- provider/gpkg: fixed index query for geomFieldname != geom (#486 @olt)
- provider/postgis: fixed error not thrown if the database user does not have permissions to access table (#538 @ARolek)
- cache seeding: invalid value for bounds () with 10e3 notation (#539 @gdey)
- fixed the way cache seed / purge with a tile-list or tile-name works. min and max zooms now must be provided for tegola to include parent and child tiles (@gdey)

**Breaking Changes**
- **IMPORTANT**: if you have a current tile cache in place, you will need to purge it entirely as tegola now expects the cache to persist gzipped tiles.
- `cors_allowed_origin` is no longer supported under the `webserver` config section. The same functionality can be implemented using the `[webserver.headers]` config which allows for configuring almost any response header. Use `Access-Control-Allow-Origin = "yourdomain.com"` in the config moving forward.
- Docker container now uses the `ENTRYPOINT` command. Users of the Docker container will need to update the commands they're passing to the container.
